# Hi there 👋

Welcome on my profile, fellow visitor ! 😁

I'm Kevin, I love programming, especially with C++, C#, Python and JavaScript.

I'm a Computer Science student currently in my 4th year of studies, so I got a Bachelor's degree and I'm about to get my Master's degree 📜. 

I love working and learning on team projects more than anything. :people_holding_hands:

I like to work in Game Developement, Computer Graphics, Machine Learning and Software Engineering.

# Hi there 👋

Welcome on my profile, fellow visitor ! 😁

I'm Kevin, a Computer Science student currently in my 5th year of studies, so I got a Bachelor's degree and I'm about to get my Master's degree 📜.
I'm planning to study for a second Master's degree at Tsinghua University where I've already had 1 year of exchange studies.
Maybe doing a PhD in the future ...?

I've had 4 internships for now, working on AI, Voice Recognition, VR/AR Games, CAD (Computer-Aided Design) softwares, Game Porting (PS4/PS5, NSwitch, XBOXOne/S).

I love Computer Graphics and Machine Learning, and I will focus on these subjects and conduct researches in the future. :people_holding_hands:
